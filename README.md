# 👋 Hi, I'm Prasath Basuvaraj

🚀 **IC Leadership Journey – Scaling Impact Through Systems, Code, and Craft**

I'm on an ongoing **IC Leadership Journey** — elevating my role as a hands-on technical leader through deep system design, platform architecture, and developer excellence.

With 20+ years of engineering experience, I specialize in:

- 🏗️ Architecting and scaling cloud-native systems using Java, Spring Boot, Docker, AWS, and OpenShift (on-prem)

- 🧱 Building resilient, maintainable, and modular platforms that power enterprise-grade apps

- 🧭 Driving clean architecture, microservices best practices, and system ownership

- 👥 Mentoring engineers and guiding cross-team initiatives as a Staff+ IC

This space showcases key projects, design patterns, and reusable templates that reflect my approach to engineering leadership through code.


📌 Featured Projects

- Spring Boot Microservice Template A modular Spring Boot starter with JWT, CI/CD, Swagger, and AWS deployment.
  
- System Design Patterns Real-world architecture diagrams, cloud-native system blueprints, and best practices.
  
- DevOps Dashboard End-to-end CI/CD setup using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes for microservices.

🧠 Currently Learning

- Advanced Kubernetes (Istio, Helm, Operators)

- OpenTelemetry & Distributed Tracing
  
- System Design at Scale (StaffEng level)
